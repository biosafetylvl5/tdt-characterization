# TdT Characterization Experiment
Written by *Michael Uttmark*
*Written:* 2/16/19 *Performed:* TBD

Procedure Purpose
=================

Characterize the rate of extension of ssDNA with varying nucleotide:DNA
ratios.

Overview
========

An array of samples will be tested with these conditions (dTTP:DNA ratio
(moles) by time of reaction):

|1  | 2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|
|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
|30s|45s|1min|2min|3min|5min|7min|10min|15min|20min|30min|Controls|
|A  | 2 ||||||||||
|B  | 3 ||||||||||
|C  | 5 ||||||||||
|D  | 7 ||||||||||
|E  | 10||||||||||
|F  | 15||||||||||
|G  | 20||||||||||
|H  | 40|H||||||||12                                                          |

Samples are addressed by their 96Well plate location (eg. H12, as marked).
They will be stopped with EDTA and sent to PAN. The most promising samples will be run on a gel for better resolution.

For PAN analysis, we will be sending in Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase extended samples with a concentration of 2ng/µL.

## Materials

-   "BS\_Start\" Oligonucleotide (Sequence: 5'-AGTTACCATGACCGTGTGCG-3')
-   "BS\_Comp\_8\" Oligonucleotide (Sequence: 5'-AACGCACA-3')
-   Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (20 U/uL)
-   dTTP (100 mM)
-   NEB Terminal Transferase Buffer (10X)
-   CoCl2 (10x)
-   RNAse Free Water

## Dilutions
1. Dilute 39.13µL of BSStart (100uM) in 960.87µL of nuclease-free water for a 24 ng/uL (3.914 uM) working stock. Vortex well.
2. Dilute 5 µL 100mM dTTP Stock in 495 µL water to 500µL of 1mM (making at least 56.347µL). Vortex well.
3. Dilute 50 uL 1mM dTTP Stock in 450µL water to 500µL of .1mM (making at least 394µL)
4. Dilute 4.32 uL of 90-mer (AGTATTCCTGTCCCCGCTCGGTATCGTGATGCTCGTGCTTATGCGAACGTGCAGATGACGTTTGGCGCGTATTTAGATGCGCTAGACGTT), 13.04 uL of 15Mer (ATGGACATGGACTAC) and 12.56 of BS-Comp-8 (AACGCACA) (both from 100uM stock) into 3970.08 µL Nuclease-Free water in a 15 mL tube. Vortex well before use. This is the DNA Control Solution.
5. Prepare a trough of a mixture of 300µL 10x Buffer and 300µL 10x CoCl_2

Procedure
=========

Prepare Plate
-------------

In to each well, pipette 3uL using a multichannel pipette from the 1:1
:10X TdT Buffer mixture into each well except H12.

For each row, create the following dilutions of dTTP from dilutes
prepared before:

|Row |dTTP Dilute (100uM)|dTTP Dilute (1993.349µL)|Water |
|----|-------------------|------------------------|------|
|A| 18.8µL|| 221.2µL
|B| 28.2µL|| 211.8µL
|C| 47µL ||193µL
|D| 65.7µL|| 174µL
|E| 93.9µL|| 146µL
|F| |14.087µL| 225.913µL
|G| |18.782µL| 221.218µL
|H| |37.565µL| 202.435µL

For each well in each row, pipette 10µL of the corresponding dTTP dilute (except H12).

For each column except for 12 pipette 4µL of Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase into each well except H12.

## Begin Experiment
For each reaction in order of decreasing incubation time, begin by pipetting in 10µL of the DNA dilute prepared earlier. Write down the time each column was started and stopped when time permits. Wait until the allotted time for that column has elapsed and cease the reaction with 10µL of EDTA.

## Controls
No Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase should be added to the controls in column 12. H12 must be left empty.

## Sending to PAN
Pipette 10uL out of each well and store in another well plate for a future gel run. Pipette in 20uL of DNA gel later)

## Stop Procedure
Ensure that all reagents have been returned to their proper storage locations and clean up the work area. Save all samples in the -20C freezer for possible future use
