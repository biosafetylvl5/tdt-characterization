# TdT Characterization Experiment
Written by *Michael Uttmark*
*Written:* 2/16/19 *Performed:* TBD

Procedure Purpose
=================

Characterize the rate of extension of ssDNA with varying nucleotide:DNA
ratios.

Overview
========

An array of samples will be tested with these conditions (dTTP:DNA ratio
(moles) by time of reaction):

|1  | 2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|
|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
|30s|45s|1min|2min|3min|5min|7min|10min|15min|20min|30min|Controls|
|A  | 2 ||||||||||
|B  | 3 ||||||||||
|C  | 5 ||||||||||
|D  | 7 ||||||||||
|E  | 10||||||||||
|F  | 15||||||||||
|G  | 20||||||||||
|H  | 40|||||||||H12                                                          |

Samples are addressed by their 96Well plate location (eg. H12, as marked).
They will be stopped with EDTA and sent to PAN. The most promising samples will be run on a gel for better resolution.

For PAN analysis, we will be sending in Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase extended samples with a concentration of 2ng/uL.

## Materials

-   "BS\_Start\" Oligonucleotide (Sequence: 5'-AGTTACCATGACCGTGTGCG-3')
-   "BS\_Comp\_8\" Oligonucleotide (Sequence: 5'-AACGCACA-3')
-   Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (20 U/uL)
-   dTTP (100 mM)
-   NEB Terminal Transferase Buffer (10X)
-   CoCl2 (10x)
-   RNAse Free Water

## Dilutions
1. Dilute 39.1uL of BSStart (100uM, 6133Da) in 960.9uL of nuclease-free water for a 24 ng/uL (3.91 uM) working stock. Vortex well.
2. Dilute 5uL 100mM dTTP Stock in 495 uL water to 500uL of 1mM Stock. Vortex well.
4. Dilute 4.4 uL of 90-mer (AGTATTCCTGTCCCCGCTCGGTATCGTGATGCTCGTGCTTATGCGAACGTGCAGATGACGTTTGGCGCGTATTTAGATGCGCTAGACGTT, 100uM, 27786Da), 13uL of 15Mer (ATGGACATGGACTAC, 100uM, 4601Da) and 12.6uL of BS-Comp-8 (AACGCACA, 100uM, 2388Da) into 3970.08 uL Nuclease-Free water in a 15 mL tube. Vortex well before use. This is the DNA Control Solution, which will result in 1.02ng/uL, ..5ng/uL and .251ng/uL final concentrations of 90, 15 and 8nt control stands.
5. Prepare a trough of a mixture of 600uL 10x Buffer and 600uL 10x CoCl2

Procedure
=========

Prepare Plate
-------------

In to each well, pipette 6uL using a multichannel pipette from the 1:1:10X TdT Buffer mixture into each well except H12.

For each row, create the following dilutions of dTTP from dilutes
prepared before:

|Row       |dTTP Dilute (1mM)| Water     |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
|A (2:1)   | 7.8uL           | 992.2uL   |
|B (3:1)   | 11.7uL          | 988.3uL   |
|C (5:1)   | 19.6uL          | 980.4uL   |
|D (7:1)   | 27.37uL         | 972.6uL   |
|E (10:1)  | 39.1uL          | 960.9uL   |
|F (15:1)  | 58.7uL          | 941.3uL   |
|G (20:1)  | 78.2uL          | 921.8uL   |
|H (40:1)  | 156.4uL         | 843.6uL   |

For each well in each row, pipette 10uL of the corresponding dTTP dilute (except H12).

For each column except for 12 pipette 4uL of Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase into each well except H12.

## Begin Experiment
For each reaction in order of decreasing incubation time, begin by pipetting in 10uL of the DNA dilute prepared earlier into an entire column simultaneously ultaniously using a multichannel pipette. Write down the time each column was started and stopped when time permits. Wait until the allotted time for that column has elapsed and cease the reaction with 10uL of EDTA.

## Controls
No Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase should be added to the controls in column 12. H12 must be left empty.

## Sending to PAN
Pipette 20uL out of each well and store in another well plate for a future gel run. Pipette in 20uL Nuclease-Free Water, submit to PAN.
